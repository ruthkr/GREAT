Registration supporting information README:

The directory "registration/" contains scripts and example gene expression data used to identify optimal registration functions between Arabidsopsis and rapa gene expression profiles. 

NB this is provided as a means to document methods, and is not intended to be used as software!


- registration_script.R: lists the R library versions used, and is the main script used for registration.

- registration_functions.R: defines functions used by registration_script.R

- data_for_registration.rds: example gene expression data for use by registration_functions.R, so that it can more easily be understood.
