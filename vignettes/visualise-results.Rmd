```

After running the registration function `register()` as shown in the [Registering data](https://ruthkr.github.io/greatR/articles/register-data.html) article, users can summarise and visualise the results as illustrated in the figure below.

<br>

```{r vis-reg-data, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/visualisation_process.png")
```

## Getting a summary from registration results

The total number of registered and non-registered genes can be obtained by running the function `summarise_registration()` with `registration_results` object as an input.

```{r load-greatR, message=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# Load the package
library(greatR)
library(data.table)
```

```{r brapa-data-results, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# Load a data frame from the sample data
registration_results <- system.file("extdata/brapa_arabidopsis_registration.rds", package = "greatR") |>
  readRDS()
```

The function `summarise_registration()` returns a list containing three different objects:

- `summary` is a data frame containing the summary of the registration results,
- `registered_genes` is a vector of gene accessions or IDs which were successfully registered, and
- `non_registered_genes` is a vector of non-registered gene accessions or IDs.

```{r get-summary-results}
# Get registration summary
reg_summary <- summarise_registration(registration_results)

reg_summary$summary |>
  knitr::kable()
```

The list of gene accessions which were registered or not registered can be viewed by calling:

```{r print-accession-of-registered-genes}
reg_summary$registered_genes
```

```{r print-accession-of-non-registered-genes}
reg_summary$non_registered_genes
```

## Plotting registration results

The function `plot_registration_results()` allows users to plot the registration results of the genes of interest.

```{r plot-results, fig.align='center', fig.height=8, fig.width=7, warning=FALSE}
# Plot registration result
plot_registration_results(
  registration_results,
  ncol = 2
)
```

Notice that the plot includes a label indicating if the particular genes are registered or not registered, as well as the registration parameters in case the registration was successful.

For more details on the other function paramaters, go to `plot_registration_results()`.

## Analysing similarity of expression profiles overtime before and after registering

### Calculate sample distance

After registering the data, users can compare the overall similarity between datasets before and after registering using the function `calculate_distance()`.

```{r get-sample-distance}
sample_distance <- calculate_distance(registration_results)
```

The function `calculate_distance()` returns a list of two data frames:

- `registered` distance between scaled reference and query expressions using registered time points.
- `original` distance between scaled reference and query expressions using original time points.

### Plot heatmap of sample distances

Each of these data frames above can be visualised using the `plot_heatmap()` function, by selecting either `type = "registered"` or `type = "original"`.

```{r plot-dist-original, fig.align='center', fig.height=5, fig.width=5, warning=FALSE}
# Plot heatmap of mean expression profiles distance before registration process
plot_heatmap(
  sample_distance,
  type = "original"
)
```

```{r plot-dist-registered, fig.align='center', fig.height=5, fig.width=5, warning=FALSE}
# Plot heatmap of mean expression profiles distance after registration process
plot_heatmap(
  sample_distance,
  type = "registered",
  match_timepoints = TRUE
)
```

Notice that we use `match_timepoints = TRUE` to match the registered query time points to the reference time points.
